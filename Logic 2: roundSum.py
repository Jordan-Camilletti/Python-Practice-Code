"""For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more,
so 15 rounds up to 20. 
Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. 
Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. """
